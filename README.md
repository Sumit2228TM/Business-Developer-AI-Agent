# 1.  What It Does
This tool identifies and ranks biotech/pharma researchers who are most likely to be interested in 3D in-vitro models for therapy development.
Input: PubMed publications on relevant topics
Output: Ranked list of leads with propensity scores (0-100)

Quick Start (3 commands)
1. Install dependencies
```
pip install biopython pandas streamlit
```

# 2. Collect leads from PubMed (takes ~5 min)
```
python collect_leads.py
```

# 3. Score the leads
```
python score_leads.py
```

# 4. Launch dashboard
```
streamlit run app.py
```

You'll have 50-100 scored leads in minutes!

## Scoring Methodology
Each lead receives a score from 0-100 based on:
FactorWeightExampleRole Fit30 ptsTitle contains "Director of Toxicology"Company Intent20 ptsWorks at funded pharma companyTechnographic15 ptsPublications mention "3D models"Location10 ptsBased in Cambridge, MA or BaselScientific Intent40 ptsPublished on DILI in last 2 years
Tiers:

Tier A (80-100): Hot leads - contact immediately

Tier B (60-79): Warm leads - qualify further

Tier C (0-59): Cold leads - long-term nurture

### Data Sources

PubMed (active): Recent publications on DILI, hepatotoxicity, 3D models

LinkedIn (future): Sales Navigator exports

NIH RePORTER (future): Grant recipients

Conferences (future): SOT, AACR attendees



## Sample Output
The dashboard shows:

50+ leads collected from PubMed

Ranked by propensity score

Filterable by tier, location, company

Exportable to CSV


Top Lead Example:

Dr. Sarah Johnson (Score: 95/100)

Director of Toxicology at Pfizer

Cambridge, MA

sarah.johnson@pfizer.com

"Assessment of DILI risk using 3D hepatic spheroids" (2024)
